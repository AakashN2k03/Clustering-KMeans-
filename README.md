# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means
## Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant attributes.
We utilize the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
